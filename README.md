# 🧠 MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN and Tkinter UI

This project implements a deep learning-based handwritten digit recognition system using the **MNIST dataset**. Leveraging the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the model is trained to accurately classify grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.

A user-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI** allows real-time drawing and prediction of digits, along with visual feedback through confidence scores.
