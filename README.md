# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-MNIST-
This project uses CNNs to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset. A Tkinter-based UI lets users draw digits in real time and get instant predictions with confidence scores. The model achieves over 98% accuracy, useful for tasks like exam checking and form digitization.
